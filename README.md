# Hypothyrodism Project

Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following:

Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

Define the question

To determine whether or not patients symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid
Metric of success

Create a model that identifies whether a patient has hypothyroid based on symptoms presented.

Experimental design taken

1. Decision trees

i. Random forests
 
ii. Ada boosted trees
 
iii. gradient boosted trees
Optimize models and determine which features are most impactful in influencing the prediction.

2. SVM using two features.

Apply Polynomial, linear and rbf kernel function to build your SVM model and then evaluate their performance and pick the kernel that performs the best.

Tune parameters to improve the performance of your model.

To make your life easier, make sure to visualize the models you've created. Use any two features to build the models for this step
